# Gravity-ball-game
This was originally planned by [@hamdivazim](https://www.github.com/hamdivazim) and [@OctoBoss1305](https://www.github.com/OctoBoss1305) in [this](https://github.com/hamdivazim/UnityGame/) repo to be created in Unity, but now repo is dead. I have been given permission by [@hamdivazim](https://www.github.com/hamdivazim) to rewrite this in pygame.
